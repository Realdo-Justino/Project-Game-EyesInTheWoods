## Description

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes in the Woods is a 2d platformer game inspired by classic games, such as Castlevania from NES. But instead of using well know cultures, the game uses **Native Brazilian** folclore as it's bases.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game happens in the **Amazon Rainforest**, where the main protagonist loses track of all his companions ans do he must find what happened. As he goes on, he find mysterious an abnormal creatures who seems to deslike the presence of him, and because of that they try to attack him at any given point 
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game tries to be hard in a way similar to NES games, **trial and error**. And as such other caracterist from this era that was used are the **Restrictive Controls**. Not only that but the player will also keep track of his ammunition and the time it takes to reload, in that way it will keep you on your toes.
